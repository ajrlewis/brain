# Mind

Mind is the product workspace for Brain and Cortex.

- [Brain](products/brain/README.md) stores governed organisational knowledge and reusable
  agent Skills.
- [Cortex](products/cortex/README.md) is the agent runtime that reasons and acts using Brain and
  external tools.

Cortex currently has a minimal FastAPI health service and Next.js product shell. Agent execution,
Brain integration, identity, persistence, and model providers remain intentionally deferred.

The products are developed together but remain independently deployable. Cortex integrates with
Brain through Brain's public HTTP or MCP interfaces and never through Brain's database.

Root workspace files coordinate shared development commands and local infrastructure. Product
implementations, tests, migrations, content, and product-specific documentation remain inside
their product directory.
